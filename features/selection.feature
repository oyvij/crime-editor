Feature: Selecting and copying

  CRIME owns selection because enabling mouse capture disables the terminal's
  own drag-to-select. Each pane selects what it actually holds: characters in
  the editor, scrollback in the terminal, the visible screen in the AI pane, and
  in the tree a drag just moves the row selection — a filename is not text you
  copy character by character.

  The AI pane picks only what is on screen. An AI CLI runs full-screen, where
  there is no history behind it to select from; ADR-0002 records why.

  Copying uses the system clipboard, and falls back to OSC 52 so that copying
  still reaches your real machine when CRIME is running over SSH.

  Background:
    Given the workspace root is "/home/me/projects/crime"

  Scenario: Dragging in the editor selects text
    Given "src/tree.js" is open in the editor holding:
      """
      run("unquoted path")
      """
    When I drag across "unquoted path" in the editor pane
    Then the selection holds "unquoted path"

  Scenario: Dragging across a line break takes both ends and the rows between
    Given "src/tree.js" is open in the editor holding:
      """
      one two
      three four
      five six
      """
    When I drag in the editor pane from line 1 column 5 to line 3 column 4

  Scenario: Dragging upward picks what dragging downward picks
    Given "src/tree.js" is open in the editor holding:

      """
      bash-5.3$ ls
      """
    When I drag across "bash-5.3$ ls" in the terminal pane
    Then the selection holds "bash-5.3$ ls"

  Scenario: Dragging across rows in the terminal takes its scrollback the same way
    Given the terminal shows:
      """
      bash-5.3$ ls
      Cargo.toml  src
      """
    When I drag in the terminal pane from line 1 column 11 to line 2 column 10

  Scenario: Copying an AI answer takes it out of the workspace
    Given a system clipboard is available
    And the AI session shows:
      """
      Use ripgrep instead.

    And I drag across "ripgrep" in the AI pane
    When I copy the selection

    Given the terminal shows:
      """
      bash-5.3$ ls
