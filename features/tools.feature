Feature: Tools — one list of everything Varde runs

  The palette's `v` opens Tools: every program Varde runs, grouped into language servers,
  formatters, requirements (`[facts.*]`) and speech — the synthesizer with its voice, and the
  player. One list rather than one per kind, because every row has the same shape: a name, the
  command it runs, and a status in one vocabulary shared by all of them.

  The list is what the config files name, and beside it every template row they do not name, read
  as `available`. That one rule answers a row the reader deleted and a row a newer Varde added to
  its template: an upgrade never edits the file, and the new row still reaches the reader here
  (`docs/adr/0018-the-global-config-is-the-list-of-programs.md`).

  Whether a command is on this machine is the edge's to observe, so scenarios state it as a fact,
  the way the language server scenarios already do.

  Background:
    Given Varde was built for "linux"

  Scenario: Tools groups its rows by kind, in one order
    Given there is no global config
    And the project has no config file
    When I open Tools
    Then the tools list is grouped as:
      | language-servers |
      | formatters       |
      | requirements     |
      | speech           |

  Scenario: A formatter row says whether its command is on this machine
    Given there is no global config
    And the project has no config file
    And the command "prettier" is on PATH
    And the command "black" is not on PATH
    And the command "pipx" is on PATH
    When I open Tools
    Then the formatter row for "markdown" is "installed"
    And the formatter row for "python" is "missing"

  Scenario: A template row the global file lacks is listed as available
    Given the global config is:
      """
      [lsp.rust]
      command = "rust-analyzer"
      extensions = ["rs"]
      """
    And the project has no config file
    And the command "rust-analyzer" is on PATH
    And the command "go" is on PATH
    And the command "npm" is on PATH
    And the command "uv" is on PATH
    When I open Tools
    Then the server row for "rust" is "installed"
    And the server row for "go" is "available"
    And the formatter row for "markdown" is "available"
    And the requirement row for "typescript_sdk" is "available"
    And the speech row for "synthesizer" is "available"

  Scenario: A row the file changed is shown as differing from its template
    Given the global config is:
      """
      [lsp.rust]
      command = "/opt/ra/rust-analyzer"
      extensions = ["rs"]

      [lsp.go]
      command = "gopls"
      extensions = ["go"]
      install.macos = "go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest"
      install.linux = "go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest"
      install.windows = "go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest"
      """
    And the project has no config file
    When I open Tools
    Then the server row for "rust" differs from its template
    And the server row for "go" is the template's

  Rule: Taking a row is the whole install

    One key writes the row and runs what installs it. A row the global file lacks is appended from
    the template, with any `[facts.*]` row its values name, and nothing already in the file is
    touched. The install runs in the shell pane, visibly, where a `sudo` prompt can be answered, and
    reports its exit status through a sentinel file the watcher already sees — the way a clone does
    (`docs/adr/0015-a-clone-is-the-users-own-git.md`). A file Varde cannot parse is refused before
    anything is written or run.

    Scenario: Taking an available row appends it to the global config and runs its install
      Given the global config is:
        """
        # Servers I chose myself.
        [lsp.rust]
        command = "rust-analyzer"

      When I take the server row for "go"
      Then the global config still holds everything it held
      And the global config names the row "lsp.go"
      And the shell pane runs "go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest" reporting its exit status

    Scenario: Taking a row whose values name a requirement appends the requirement too
      Given the global config is:
        """
        [lsp.rust]
        command = "rust-analyzer"
        extensions = ["rs"]

      And the global config names the row "facts.typescript_sdk"

    Scenario: Taking a row the global config already has only runs its install
      Given the global config is:
        """
        [lsp.go]
        command = "gopls"

      And the global config is unchanged

      Given the global config is:

      And I took the server row for "go"
      When the install reports the exit status "1"
      Then the server row for "go" is "install-failed"

  Rule: A missing package manager is refused before anything runs

    The program an install command starts with, or the one after `sudo`, is probed on `PATH` like
    any command. A row whose package manager is missing reads `needs-installer` and names it, and
    taking it writes nothing and runs nothing: package managers are `install.sh`'s to install.

    Scenario: A row whose install starts with a program not on PATH names it
      Given the global config is:
        """

      And the command "go" is not on PATH
      When I open Tools
      Then the server row for "go" is "installed"

  Rule: A missing requirement offers its own install

    A server whose command is here and whose required `[facts.*]` row finds nothing reads
    `missing-requirement` and names the fact. The usual cause is machine-wide — a language server on
    `PATH` with no classic `tsc` beside it — so a fact may carry `install.<os>` like a program row,
    and taking the server's row runs the fact's install exactly as taking a server runs the
    server's. A fact stays a search: the install puts `tsc` on `PATH` and the next search finds the
    SDK beside it, and nothing found is ever written into the file.

    Scenario: A row missing a requirement names it
      Given there is no global config
      And the project has no config file
      And the command "vue-language-server" is on PATH
      And the edge resolved no "typescript_sdk"
      When I open Tools
      Then the server row for "vue" is "missing-requirement"
      And the server row for "vue" needs the requirement "typescript_sdk"

      When I re-check the row for "vue"
      And the command "tsc" is not on PATH
      Then Varde asks whether to restart

  Rule: An install writes what it configures

    Some installs put a value on disk that the row then has to name: the speech install downloads a
    voice, and `speech.voice` has to say where. So a row may carry `configures`, the keys its install
    makes true, written into the global config once the install exits with status 0 — each one the
    file does not already set, since the reader's value beats the template's. The value is written
    as the row spells it, `~` and all (`docs/adr/0018-the-global-config-is-the-list-of-programs.md`).

    Scenario: The speech install exiting 0 writes the voice it configures
